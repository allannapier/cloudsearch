# cloudsearch

This script will allow you to quickly search both your local directories and a S3 Bucket for a file using a search term.

Please ensure you fill in the s3_bucket and local_path, if you don't wish to search one of them just set the variable to '' and ensure it has been omitted from the locations list underneath.
